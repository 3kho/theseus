# hack club's shiny new mail system!
it's open source now i guess

getting this running if you're not me or production is probably kind of a bear!

i will write seeds and a way to log in without setting up a slack....at...some point.....

(possibly not soon due to time constraints)

if you wanna hack on this and contribute, dm me (@nora) on slack, i'd love the help!

a lot of the design decisions and code are not great. they will be incrementally improved someday. (you can look towards issues for some of that)

thanks for being here!
